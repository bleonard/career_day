## Career Day

Tomorrow is bring your child to work day. I am tasked with teaching what it means to "code" to a group of 5-7 year old children.

This is the plan.

### Computers are stupid

    Who thinks computers are smart?

Assumably, they will raise their hands.

    And what do computers do?
    
If not prompted, I'll talk about how they do just about everything: actual computers, phones, cars, airplanes, toys, etc.

    Let me tell you a secret not everyone knows... computers are stupid. Stupid!
    
    They need smart people like your mom and dads to tell them *exactly* what to do. 
    They seem smart because they can do what they are told very very quickly, but they it's only because your mom and dads are so smart.
    
    Here at TaskRabbit, it's my job and a lot of other people's job to tell computers exactly what to do so they can help people.

### Peanut butter and jelly

So I have a knife, fork, spoon, plate, peanut butter, jelly, bread, napkin, etc. 

What I am going to do is ask them to tell me how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, but I'm going to act like a computer.

That is, I will be very literal and purposefully screw things up. Hopefully, they will catch on and be more and more precise.

### Guesser

Then, I am going to teach one of the children how to play a game.

* Think of a number between 1 and 10 (inclusive).
* Point at someone and ask their name.
* Other child tells you their name.
* Ask them to pick a number.
* Other child tell you a number.
* You tell them if it was the right number, too high, or too low.
* If right, game over.
* If too high or low, ask next child.

Hopefully that works.

### Code

Then I'm going to run the code in this repository (bin/picker).

    $ guesser
    
And have it play the game a few times.

Then I'll show them the code and explain how it works.

SHould be about 30 minutes total.
